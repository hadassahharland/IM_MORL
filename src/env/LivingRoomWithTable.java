// Extends the BreakableBottles, Sokoban and Doors gridworlds proposed in ...low-impact agents for AI safety by Vamplew et al (2021)
// A simple gridworld designed to test the ability of agents to minimise unintended impact
// on the environmental state, particularly irreversible changes. Additionally, this agent
// recognises harm to an actor and apologises.
// Follows the methodology proposed by Leike et al where there is an reward function which
// is provided to the agent (in the first element of the reward vector), and a
// separate performance function used for evaluation which is not disclosed to the agent
// (in fact for simplicity of implementation, this code does included that value as the
// final element of the reward vector, but the agents are implemented so as to ignore it).
// Our implementation also provides a potential-based impact-minimising reward as the 2nd
// element in the vector, for use by our impact-minimising agent). Again in a clean
// implementation this should probably be calculated by the agent itself, but this
// approach is faster for me to implement, given pressing conference deadlines
